# Fake-News-Detection-using-ML-and-NLP
This project focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning and natural language processing. The dataset is preprocessed through tokenization, stopword removal, and text cleaning. TF-IDF vectorization is used to convert news articles into numerical features, and models such as Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier are trained for classification. The system achieves high accuracy in distinguishing real and fake news. The project includes training scripts, a saved model, and a prediction module that allows users to input custom news text for verification. This fake news detector can be extended for real-time applications and improved with deep learning techniques.
